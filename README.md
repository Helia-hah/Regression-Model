# Regression-Model

### getData function:
In this function, for a given value of N and σ<sup> 2</sup>, the dataset with a set of N (X, Y)(denoted as {(xi, yi) : i = 1, 2, . . . N}) pairs is generated based on the following formula: <br />
Y = cos(2πX) + Z <br />
Where X values are drawn uniformly at random from (0, 1) and Z is a zero mean Gaussian random variable with variance σ<sup> 2</sup>.
