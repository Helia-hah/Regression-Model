### getData function:
In this project the dataset was generated based on the following formula: <br />
Y = cos(2πX) + Z <br />
Where X and Y are random variables that take real values, with X specifically taking values in the interval (0, 1) and Z is a zero mean Gaussian random variable with variance σ<sup> 2</sup>.
