# Regression-Model
In this project a polynomial regression model was implemented and the built model was evaluated based on following parameters: <br />
 Markup : * model complexity:d ∈ {0, 1, 2, . . . , 20} 
          * sample size: N ∈ {2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200}
          * standard deviation: σ ∈ {0.01, 0.1, 1}
          
 Markup : * Bullet list
              * Nested bullet
                  * Sub-nested bullet etc
          * Bullet list item 2
          

### getData function:
In this function, for a given value of N and σ<sup> 2</sup>, the dataset with a set of N (X, Y) (denoted as {(xi, yi) : i = 1, 2, . . . N}) pairs was generated based on the following formula: <br />
Y = cos(2πX) + Z <br />
Where X values are drawn uniformly at random from (0, 1) and Z is a zero mean Gaussian random variable with variance σ<sup> 2</sup>. <br />
